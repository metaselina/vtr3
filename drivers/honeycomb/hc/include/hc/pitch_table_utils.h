// Parses a pitch table specification string into a vector of doubles.

// Pitch tables can be expressed as a comma-separated list of rangeexpressions.
// These range expressions get expanded into a single vector of double precision
// floating-point numbers and are sorted in descending order, as expected by the
// pitch table API.
//
// Range expressions are either single values or colon-delimited 'start',
// 'stop', and 'step' values.  If the optional step value is not provided, it is
// assumed to be 1.0.
//
// If a single value is given, it is added to the resulting vector.  Otherwise
// the values beginning with 'start' are added to the vector, incrementing by
// 'step', while the resulting value is less than or equal to 'stop'.
//
// If the input is invalid, an error message is set in error_str and the
// function returns an empty vector.
